# A Tinder bot that's also a pretty hot duck

Would swipe right, tbh.

Built using the bones of Joel Auterson (@JoelOtter)'s [Tinder bots from 2015] (http://www.joelotter.com/2015/05/17/dj-khaled-tinder-bot.html). Updated significantly for maximum duck-age.

Uses [Pynder](https://github.com/charliewolf/pynder) to talk to Tinder.
